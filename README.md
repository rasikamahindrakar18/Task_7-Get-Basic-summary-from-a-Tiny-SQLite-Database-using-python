## ðŸ“Œ Task Objective

- Use SQLite inside Python to pull basic sales summary info.
- Show total quantity and revenue by product.
- Display the output using print and a simple bar chart.


## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python
- SQLite (sqlite3 module)
- pandas
- matplotlib


## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

-  Sales summary.pdf: The main Python script
- Sales_Data_Task7.xlsx: SQLite database with 20 rows of sales data
- README.md: Project documentation


## ðŸ§¾ Sales Data Sample

The data includes 20 rows with products like:

- Laptop
- Mouse
- Keyboard
- Monitor
- Headphones

Each row contains:
- product
- quantity
- price


## ðŸ§  What the Script Does

1. Connects to an SQLite database.
2. Creates a sales table.
3. Inserts 20 sample sales records.
4. Runs an SQL query to:
   - Group data by product
   - Calculate total quantity and total revenue
5. Displays the summary using print().
6. Plots a revenue bar chart using matplotlib.


## ðŸ“Š SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT 
    product, 
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, 
    SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
